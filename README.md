# NES-15-puzzle
A simple game to test out NES development.

All it does right now is display a static screen, but I eventually hope to turn this into a functioning 15-tile game with controls, sound, and win detection.

Graphics made using NES Screen Tool by Shiru

Compiled using cc65 and tested using MESEN 0.9.9 with all developer settings enabled
